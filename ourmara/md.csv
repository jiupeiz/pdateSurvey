It sounded just like the canons they shoot off in       Charlestown, and I remember thinking it was strange, but also that fireworks or some other       display were not out of the question. I turned and saw the smoke, and then the second       explosion happened. People started running, but then volunteers told everyone to remain calm,       keep walking through the finish area, get your medal, bag, etc. In hindsight, after seeing all       of the photos and videos of the chaos going on not even a block away, it seems crazy that as       that was happening, I was having a medal put around my neck.",http://hdl.handle.net/2047/D20265372,Texts (documents),[],[],[]

T, and smoke a few blocks up Newbury street (second bomb?). Then       sirens, and murmurs of ""bombs"". I immediately called my wife, who I found out was at the       Berkeley and Boylston Starbucks. We met at Berkley and Newbury, and tried to keep our group of       adults and kids together as we walked to the com ave mall as people were running towards us in       panic. (They were actually clearing the way for the first ambulances). We proceeded up the       mall, and saw a chemical decon unit. People on the street told us in graphic detail that there       had been casualties, in panic. We tried to walk directly back to Brookline but kept being       diverted as the streets closed because of the threat of more bombs. Very tragic, sad, chaotic,       scary, surreal, infuriating. First Boston ever, from New Mexico (but have family in Boston and       North Andover). I want to run next year and show these bastards we won't be deterred.
